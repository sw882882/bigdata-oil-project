The amount of net personal wealth estimated here is much less than the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets. The difference could be explained as follows. First, the net household wealth in the National Balance Sheets includes the asset of non-profit sector. Second, the estimate of net personal wealth covers only real estate and financial assets, while other kinds of assets are included in the National Balance Sheets. Third, while the real estates in the National Balance Sheets are those in market prices, they are in government appraisal values, lower than market prices. Considering the share of real estate in the net household wealth is 76% (the average in 2000-2013)  and the total amount in government appraisal values is 67% of that in market prices, the net household wealth would be underestimated as much as 25% at least from the difference in government appraisal values and market prices of real estate.;"[URL][URL_LINK]http://wid.world/document/wealth-inequality-in-korea-2000-2013-journal-of-the-korean-welfare-state-and-social-policy-2018/[/URL_LINK][URL_TEXT]Kim, Nak Nyeon(2018), Wealth Inequality in Korea, 2000-2013: Evidence from Inheritance Tax Statistics; [/URL_TEXT][/URL]";;
